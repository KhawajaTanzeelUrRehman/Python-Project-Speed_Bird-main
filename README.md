We have created flappy bird for PC with new features.

The original flappy bird game is only about flying bird and preventing it from hitting the obstacles.
We have added the following new features:
1)A game menu from where the user can select different backgrounds and birds.	
2)Silver coins which will be collected by the user and after collecting certain number of coins the user will get a new bird as a reward.
3)Golden coins which will be collected by the user and after collecting certain number of coins the user will have an option to select a new background for the game.
4)Different game levels depending on the scores of the user. In each level the speed of the bird will increase gradually.
5)Hurdles at different orientation (original game only has vertical hurdles.)







Steps to run the game:

1) Download the latest version of python from the following link.
		https://www.python.org/downloads/
2) Install it and remember to check mark the option of adding python to windows path.
3) Click on the search bar and open cmd.
4) Type a cammand (pip install pygame) and hit the enter button.
5) Go to the speed bird folder.
6) Run the speed bird.py file.
7) Enjoy the game.
